### Hi, I'm Joachim ðŸ‘‹

I'm an oldy full stack developer, teacher and public speaker. I was the creator of [MIH-fr](https://web.archive.org/web/20081102000256/http://www.mih-fr.net/), a website related to news about IT-Hardware. But it was also a community of lots of aficionados and fan of hardware tuning and benchmarking.
Currently, I'm working as React Developer.
